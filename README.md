# Semi-Automated MRI Quality Assurance with the MagNET Test Objects
## Synopsis
A set of [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/) macros to perform semi-automated analyses of MR Quality Assurance (QA) images of the MagNET test objects.

## Usage
Instructions for performing the acquisition and analysis for the following MagNET tests are described below:
- [Signal-to-Noise ratio and uniformity tests](./docs/snr_and_uniformity.md)
- [Geometric linearity, distortion and slice width tests](./docs/geometric_distortion_linearity_and_slice_width.md)
- [Slice position test](./docs/slice_position.md)
- [EPI stability](./docs/epi_stability.md)

An [Excel template](./MagNET_QA_Analysis_Template.xlsx) to collate the results of these tests is also included.

## Requirements
